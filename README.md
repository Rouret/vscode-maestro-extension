## Features

- **TreeView**, you can see folders and Maestro files. However, other types of files are not displayed; please use the default explorer for those.
- Some **Snippets**

## Roadmap
- **A linter** with the purpose of identifying potential errors before even executing the script. For instance, it checks if the paths in runFlow are correct and whether the environment variables required by child scripts are properly provided.

- **A language grammar**, which would enable developers to know the parameters and available commands directly within Visual Studio Code, thus avoiding constant referencing to the official documentation
